In Slanter.mod (in the .rar) change the 'path' to whereever you put the mod in the paradox documents and mods folder. This is my one:

path="F:/Documents/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/Slanter" 
(Idk why there's two documents)

Put the 'Slanter' folder in 'F:\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod' (where your documents paradox folder is)
next, put the 'Slanter.mod' in the same folder but NOT INSIDE THE SLANTER FOLDER.
